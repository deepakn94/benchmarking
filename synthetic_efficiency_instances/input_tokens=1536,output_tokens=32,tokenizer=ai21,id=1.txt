input: "ghbourhood, this truth is so well\n      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is\n      considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their\n      daughters.\n\n      \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you\n      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\n      \u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and\n      she told me all about it.\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet made no answer.\n\n      \u201cDo not you want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife\n      impatiently.\n\n      \u201c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d\n\n      This was invitation enough.\n\n      \u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is\n      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;\n      that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the\n      place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.\n      Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before\n      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by\n      the end of next week.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\n\n      \u201cBingley.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIs he married or single?\u201d\n\n      \u201cOh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow so? how can it affect them?\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\n      them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d\n\n      \u201cDesign! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\n      the best of the party.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\n      thinking of her own beauty.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\n      comes into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\n      little Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\n      giving _her_ the preference.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he;\n      \u201cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\n      nerves.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\n      consideration these twenty years at least.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\n      will not visit them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\n      visit them all.\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\n      solace was visiting and news.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\n      with,\n\n      \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her\n      mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him\n      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\n      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\n      have no opinion of her.\u201d\n\n      \u201cNo more have I,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; \u201cand I am glad to find that\n      you do not depend on her serving you.\u201d\n\n      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\n      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n      \u201cDon\u2019t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven\u2019s sake! Have a little\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\u201d\n\n      \u201cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\u201d said her father; \u201cshe\n      times them ill.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI do not cough for my own amusement,\u201d replied Kitty fretfully.\n      \u201cWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\u201d\n\n      \u201cTo-morrow fortnight.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAye, so it is,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand Mrs. Long does not come\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\n      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.\u201d\n\n      \u201cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\n      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\u201d\n\n      \u201cI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\u2019s acquaintance is\n      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\n      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\n      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\n      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\n      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\u201d\n\n   "
