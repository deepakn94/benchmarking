You and the girls may go, or you may\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\n      the best of the party.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\n      thinking of her own beauty.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\n      comes into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\n      little Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\n      giving _her_ the preference.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he;\n      \u201cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\n      nerves.\ufffd"
