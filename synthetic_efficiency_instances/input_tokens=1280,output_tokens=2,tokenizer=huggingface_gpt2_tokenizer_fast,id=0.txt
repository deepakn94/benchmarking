I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \u201cI wonder how\nmany miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all\nthe right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you\u2019re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what\nan ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201d\n(Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and\nsometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer\neither question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but"
