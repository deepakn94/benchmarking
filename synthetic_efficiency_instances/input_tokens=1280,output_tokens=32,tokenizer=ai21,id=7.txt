What do you deduce from\nit?\u201d\n\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\nwritten.\n\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked,\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could not\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\nstiff.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is not an English\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\n\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d\nwith a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\n\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\n\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019\nwhich is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like\nour \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume\nfrom his shelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a\nGerman-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\nthat?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\nfrom his cigarette.\n\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\npeculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from\nall quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\ndoubts.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\nwhistled.\n\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of\nthe window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\nand fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there\nis nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\n\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\nauthoritative tap.\n\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\n\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\nof obstinacy.\n\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\nmarked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\nhave I the honour to address?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\nalone.\u201d\n\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\nmy chair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before this\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\n\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he,\n\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\nEuropean history.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor. \u201cThe august\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\nnot exactly my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\nkings of Bohemia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\n\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI\nshould be better able to advise you.\u201d\n\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d\nhe cried; \u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von"
