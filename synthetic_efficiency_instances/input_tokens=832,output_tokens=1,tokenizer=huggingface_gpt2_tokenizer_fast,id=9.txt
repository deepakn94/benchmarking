Place and walked slowly, as though\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\n\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\n\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\nslip out unseen.\n\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\naware of his fears.\n\n\u201cI want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\ntrifles,\u201d he thought, with an odd smile. \u201cHm... yes, all is in a man\u2019s\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that\u2019s an axiom. It would\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\ntoo much. It\u2019s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I\u2019ve learned to chatter this\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It\u2019s simply a fantasy to amuse\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.\u201d\n\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man\u2019s already\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\ndisgust gleamed for a moment"
