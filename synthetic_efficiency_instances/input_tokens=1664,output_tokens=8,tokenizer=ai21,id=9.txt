He had counted\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\nthis \u201chideous\u201d dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\n\u201crehearsal\u201d of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\nand more violent.\n\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\nworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\nsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\nThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\ntwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\nthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\nat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\nstaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\nin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\n\n\u201cIf I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\nI were really going to do it?\u201d he could not help asking himself as he\nreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\nwho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\nflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\nfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\nstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. \u201cThat\u2019s a good\nthing anyway,\u201d he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\nwoman\u2019s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\ntin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\nthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\nits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\nclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\nby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\nwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\nnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\nBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\nopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\nwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\nhim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\nwithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\nlittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\nwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\nwhich looked like a hen\u2019s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\nfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\ninstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\nexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\n\n\u201cRaskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,\u201d the young man made\nhaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\npolite.\n\n\u201cI remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,\u201d the\nold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\n\n\u201cAnd here... I am again on the same errand,\u201d Raskolnikov continued, a\nlittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman\u2019s mistrust. \u201cPerhaps\nshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\ntime,\u201d he thought with an uneasy feeling.\n\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\nand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\nin front of her:\n\n\u201cStep in, my good sir.\u201d\n\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\nthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\nlighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\n\n\u201cSo the sun will shine like this _then_ too!\u201d flashed as it were by\nchance through Raskolnikov\u2019s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\nremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\nfurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\na huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\ndressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\nframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\nall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\nwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\neverything shone.\n\n\u201cLizaveta\u2019s work,\u201d thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\nto be seen in the whole flat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\ncleanliness,\u201d Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\nat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\nwhich stood the old woman\u2019s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\nhad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d the old woman said severely, coming into the room\nand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\nthe face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought something to pawn here,\u201d and he drew out of his pocket\nan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\nglobe; the chain was of steel.\n\n\u201cBut the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\nbefore yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\nyour pledge at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou come with such trifles, my good sir, it\u2019s scarcely worth anything.\nI gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\nquite new at a jeweler\u2019s for a rouble and a half.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father\u2019s. I\nshall be getting some money soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cA rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!\u201d\n\n\u201cA rouble and a half!\u201d cried the young man.\n\n\u201cPlease yourself\u201d--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\nyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\naway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\nelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\n\n\u201cHand it over,\u201d he said roughly.\n\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\nthe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\nthe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\nher unlocking the chest of drawers.\n\n\u201cIt must be the top drawer,\u201d he reflected. \u201cSo she carries the keys in\na pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there\u2019s\none key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\nthat can\u2019t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\nother chest or strong-box... that\u2019s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\nhave keys like that... but how degrading it all is.\u201d\n\nThe old woman came back.\n\n\u201cHere, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\nfifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\nfor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\non the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\naltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\nwatch. Here it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so.\u201d\n\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\nold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\nsomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\nwhat.\n\n\u201cI may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\nIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\nback from a friend...\u201d he broke off in confusion.\n\n\u201cWell, we will talk about it then, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\nyou?\u201d He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the\npassage.\n\n\u201cWhat business is she of yours, my good sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,"
