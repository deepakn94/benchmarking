input: " seen long and honorable service,\nas became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as\nthat of Morrel & Son,\u201d replied Danglars.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d replied the owner, glancing after Dant\u00e8s, who was watching the\nanchoring of his vessel, \u201cit seems to me that a sailor needs not be so\nold as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend\nEdmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require\ninstruction from anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate.\n\u201cYes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was\nthe captain\u2019s breath out of his body when he assumed the command\nwithout consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at\nthe Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.\u201d\n\n0025m\n\n\n\n\u201cAs to taking command of the vessel,\u201d replied Morrel, \u201cthat was his\nduty as captain\u2019s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of\nElba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are,\nM. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the\npleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cDant\u00e8s,\u201d said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, \u201ccome this\nway!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a moment, sir,\u201d answered Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand I\u2019m with you.\u201d Then calling\nto the crew, he said, \u201cLet go!\u201d\n\nThe anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through\nthe port-hole. Dant\u00e8s continued at his post in spite of the presence of\nthe pilot, until this man\u0153uvre was completed, and then he added,\n\u201cHalf-mast the colors, and square the yards!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Danglars, \u201che fancies himself captain already, upon my\nword.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so, in fact, he is,\u201d said the owner.\n\n\u201cExcept your signature and your partner\u2019s, M. Morrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why should he not have this?\u201d asked the owner; \u201che is young, it is\ntrue, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.\u201d\n\nA cloud passed over Danglars\u2019 brow.\n\n\u201cYour pardon, M. Morrel,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, approaching, \u201cthe vessel now\nrides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?\u201d\n\nDanglars retreated a step or two. \u201cI wished to inquire why you stopped\nat the Island of Elba?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain\nLeclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen did you see him, Edmond?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe marshal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMorrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dant\u00e8s on one side, he said\nsuddenly\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd how is the emperor?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw the emperor, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe entered the marshal\u2019s apartment while I was there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you spoke to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it was he who spoke to me, sir,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, with a smile.\n\n\u201cAnd what did he say to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the\ncourse she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not\nbeen laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I\ntold him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &\nSon. \u2018Ah, yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners\nfrom father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same\nregiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c_Pardieu!_ and that is true!\u201d cried the owner, greatly delighted. \u201cAnd\nthat was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain.\nDant\u00e8s, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you\nwill see it will bring tears into the old soldier\u2019s eyes. Come, come,\u201d\ncontinued he, patting Edmond\u2019s shoulder kindly, \u201cyou did very right,\nDant\u00e8s, to follow Captain Leclere\u2019s instructions, and touch at Elba,\nalthough if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the\nmarshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into\ntrouble.\u201d\n\n0027m\n\n\n\n\u201cHow could that bring me into trouble, sir?\u201d asked Dant\u00e8s; \u201cfor I did\nnot even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made\nsuch inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are\nthe health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.\u201d And\nthe young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached,\nand said,\u2014\n\n\u201cWell, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his\nlanding at Porto-Ferrajo?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so much the better,\u201d said the supercargo; \u201cfor it is not\npleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDant\u00e8s has done his,\u201d replied the owner, \u201cand that is not saying much.\nIt was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalking of Captain Leclere, has not Dant\u00e8s given you a letter from\nhim?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me?\u2014no\u2014was there one?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter\nto his care.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what packet are you speaking, Danglars?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that which Dant\u00e8s left at Porto-Ferrajo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?\u201d\n\nDanglars turned very red.\n\n\u201cI was passing close to the door of the captain\u2019s cabin, which was half\nopen, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dant\u00e8s.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did not speak to me of it,\u201d replied the shipowner; \u201cbut if there be\nany letter he will give it to me.\u201d\n\nDanglars reflected for a moment. \u201cThen, M. Morrel, I beg of you,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cnot to say a word to Dant\u00e8s on the subject. I may have been\nmistaken.\u201d\n\nAt this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.\n\n\u201cWell, my dear Dant\u00e8s, are you now free?\u201d inquired the owner.\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have not been long detained.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and\nas to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I\ngave them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have nothing more to do here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014everything is all right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you can come and dine with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due\nto my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have\ndone me.\u201d\n\n0029m\n\n\n\n\u201cRight, Dant\u00e8s, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d inquired Dant\u00e8s, with some hesitation, \u201cdo you know how my\nfather is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your\nabsence.\u201d\n\nDant\u00e8s smiled. \u201cMy father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left,\nI doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from\nHeaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has\nbeen paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, Dant\u00e8s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who\nexpects you no less impatiently than your father\u2014the lovely Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d\n\nDant\u00e8s blushed.\n\n\u201cAh, ha,\u201d said the shipowner, \u201cI am not in the least surprised, for she\nhas been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the\n_Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not my mistress,\u201d replied the young sailor, gravely; \u201cshe is my\nbetrothed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes one and the same thing,\u201d said Morrel, with a smile.\n\n\u201cNot with us, sir,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s.\n\n\u201cWell, well, my dear Edmond,\u201d continued the owner, \u201cdon\u2019t let me detain\nyou. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all\nthe time you require for your own. Do you want any money?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir; I have all my pay to take\u2014nearly three months\u2019 wages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a careful fellow, Edmond.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay I have a poor father, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see\nyour father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those\nwho detained him from me after a three months\u2019 voyage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I have your leave, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, if you have nothing more to say to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your\nleave of absence for some days.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo get married?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, first, and then to go to Paris.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good; have what time you require, Dant\u00e8s. It will take quite six\nweeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until\nthree months after that; only be back again in three months, for the\n_Pharaon_,\u201d added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back,\n\u201ccannot sail without her captain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout her captain!\u201d cried Dant\u00e8s, his eyes sparkling"
