And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\nreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\ndray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: \u201cHey there, German\nhatter\u201d bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\nman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\nround hat from Zimmerman\u2019s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\ntorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\nfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\nhad overtaken him.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he muttered in confusion, \u201cI thought so! That\u2019s the worst\nof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\nspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\nand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\nsort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\na hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\nmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\na clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it\u2019s just such\ntrifles that always ruin everything....\u201d\n\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\nof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\nthis \u201chideous\u201d dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\n\u201crehearsal\u201d of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\nand more violent.\n\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\nworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\nsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\nThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\ntwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\nthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\nat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\nstaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\nin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\n\n\u201cIf I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\nI were really going to do it?\u201d he could not help asking himself as he\nreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\nwho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\nflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\nfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\nstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. \u201cThat\u2019s a good\nthing anyway,\u201d he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\nwoman\u2019s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\ntin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\nthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\nits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\nclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\nby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\nwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\nnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\nBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\nopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\nwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\nhim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\nwithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\nlittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\nwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\nwhich looked like a hen\u2019s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\nfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\ninstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\nexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\n\n\u201cRaskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,\u201d the young man made\nhaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\npolite.\n\n\u201cI remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,\u201d the\nold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\n\n\u201cAnd here... I am again on the same errand,\u201d Raskolnikov continued, a\nlittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman\u2019s mistrust. \u201cPerhaps\nshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\ntime,\u201d he thought with an uneasy feeling.\n\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\nand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\nin front of her:\n\n\u201cStep in, my good sir.\u201d\n\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\nthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\nlighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\n\n\u201cSo the sun will shine like this _then_ too!\u201d flashed as it were by\nchance through Raskolnikov\u2019s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\nremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\nfurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\na huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\ndressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\nframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\nall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\nwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\neverything shone.\n\n\u201cLizaveta\u2019s work,\u201d thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\nto be seen in the whole flat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\ncleanliness,\u201d Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\nat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\nwhich stood the old woman\u2019s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\nhad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d the old woman said severely, coming into the room\nand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\nthe face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought something to pawn here,\u201d and he drew out of his pocket\nan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\nglobe; the chain was of steel.\n\n\u201cBut the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\nbefore yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\nyour pledge at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanov"
