Have a little\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\u201d\n\n      \u201cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\u201d said her father; \u201cshe\n      times them ill.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI do not cough for my own amusement,\u201d replied Kitty fretfully.\n      \u201cWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\u201d\n\n      \u201cTo-morrow fortnight.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAye, so it is,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand Mrs. Long does not come\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\n      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.\u201d\n\n      \u201cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\n      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\u201d\n\n      \u201cI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\u2019s acquaintance is\n      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\n      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\n      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\n      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\n      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\u201d\n\n      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\n      \u201cNonsense, nonsense!\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\u201d cried he.\n      \u201cDo you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\n      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\n      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep\n      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.\u201d\n\n      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n\n      \u201cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\u201d he continued, \u201clet us return\n      to Mr. Bingley.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\u201d cried his wife.\n\n      \u201cI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so\n      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not\n      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\n      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\u201d\n\n      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\n      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first\n      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\n      had expected all the while.\n\n      \u201cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\n      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\n      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\n      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\n      never said a word about it till now.\u201d\n\n      \u201cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\u201d said Mr.\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\n      raptures of his wife.\n\n      \u201cWhat an excellent father you have, girls,\u201d said she, when the\n      door was shut. \u201cI do not know how you will ever make him amends\n      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of\n      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\n      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do\n      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\n      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\u201d\n\n      \u201cOh!\u201d said Lydia stoutly, \u201cI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\n      youngest, I\u2019m the tallest.\u201d\n\n      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\n      would return Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and determining when they should\n      ask him to dinner.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\n      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\n      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\n      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,\n      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\n      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the\n      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\n      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\n      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\n      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\n      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\n      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\u2019s heart were entertained.\n\n      \u201cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\n      Netherfield,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \u201cand all the\n      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\u201d\n\n      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and sat\n      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\n      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\n      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\n      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\n      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and\n      rode a black horse.\n\n      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\n      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\n      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\n      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\n      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their\n      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\n      not imagine"
