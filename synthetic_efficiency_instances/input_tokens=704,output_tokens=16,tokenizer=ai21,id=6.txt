You have no compassion on my poor\n      nerves.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\n      consideration these twenty years at least.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\n      will not visit them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\n      visit them all.\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\n      solace was visiting and news.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\n      with,\n\n      \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her\n      mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him\n      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\n      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\n      have no opinion of her.\u201d\n\n      \u201cNo more have I,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; \u201cand I am glad to find that\n      you do not depend on her serving you.\u201d\n\n      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\n      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n      \u201cDon\u2019t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven\u2019s sake! Have a little\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\u201d\n\n      \u201cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\u201d said her father; \u201cshe\n      times them ill.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI do not cough for my own amusement,\u201d replied Kitty fretfully.\n      \u201cWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\u201d\n\n      \u201cTo-morrow fortnight.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAye, so it is,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand Mrs. Long does not come\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of"
