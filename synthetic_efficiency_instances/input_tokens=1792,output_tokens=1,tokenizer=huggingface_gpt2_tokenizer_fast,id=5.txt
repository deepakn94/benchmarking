First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d\nsaid Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.\n\n\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two\npeople! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!\u201d\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n\u201cEAT ME\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said\nAlice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll\nget into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which\nway?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n\n\n\u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow I\u2019m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u201d\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m\nsure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be\nkind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.\u201d\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must\ngo by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending\npresents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n     _Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice\u2019s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than"
