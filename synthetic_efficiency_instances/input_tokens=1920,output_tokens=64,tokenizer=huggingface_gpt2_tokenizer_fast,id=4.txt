input: "rship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\nknowing of the intention to set up a printing press.\u201d Under Nicholas\nI. (that \u201cstern and just man,\u201d as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months\u2019 imprisonment\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: \u201cThey snapped\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\nus our lives.\u201d The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\n\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\nnever regained his sanity.\n\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\nDostoevsky\u2019s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\nhe began the \u201cDead House,\u201d and some years of service in a disciplinary\nbattalion.\n\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--\u201cVremya,\u201d which was\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother\u2019s debts. He started\nanother journal--\u201cThe Epoch,\u201d which within a few months was also\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother\u2019s family was\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\n\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\n\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\nvast multitude of mourners, who \u201cgave the hapless man the funeral of a\nking.\u201d He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\n\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\ninspired by Dostoevsky: \u201cHe was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\nour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\nwe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\nwhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\nbecame great.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\nthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\n\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\n\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\nslip out unseen.\n\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\naware of his fears.\n\n\u201cI want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\ntrifles,\u201d he thought, with an odd smile. \u201cHm... yes, all is in a man\u2019s\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that\u2019s an axiom. It would\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\ntoo much. It\u2019s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I\u2019ve learned to chatter this\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It\u2019s simply a fantasy to amuse\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.\u201d\n\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man\u2019s already\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man\u2019s refined face. He was,\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\nfood.\n\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\nthat"
