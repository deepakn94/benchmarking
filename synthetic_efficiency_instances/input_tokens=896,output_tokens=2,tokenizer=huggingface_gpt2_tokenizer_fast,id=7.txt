input: ", and that you have a most clumsy and careless\nservant girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\nhave changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\n\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\nprocess of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked,\n\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\ndown into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\nupon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\n\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it\nsaid, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\nwear a mask.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine that it\nmeans?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no data yet."
