However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,\nfor she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the\nnarrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity\nand vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\ndirection of the pilot.\n\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\nalongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La\nR\u00e9serve basin.\n\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship\u2019s\nbulwarks.\n\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with\nblack eyes, and hair as dark as a raven\u2019s wing; and his whole\nappearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men\naccustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n\n\u201cAh, is it you, Dant\u00e8s?\u201d cried the man in the skiff. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nmatter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?\u201d\n\n\u201cA great misfortune, M. Morrel,\u201d replied the young man, \u201ca great\nmisfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave\nCaptain Leclere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the cargo?\u201d inquired the owner, eagerly.\n\n\u201cIs all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that\nhead. But poor Captain Leclere\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d asked the owner, with an air of considerable\nresignation. \u201cWhat happened to the worthy captain?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died.\u201d\n\n\u201cFell into the sea?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.\u201d Then turning to\nthe crew, he said, \u201cBear a hand there, to take in sail!\u201d\n\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the\ncrew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and\nouthaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail\nclewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his\norders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to\nthe owner.\n\n\u201cAnd how did this misfortune occur?\u201d inquired the latter, resuming the\ninterrupted conversation.\n\n0023m\n\n\n\n\u201cAlas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the\nharbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.\nIn twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days\nafterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his\nrest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head\nand his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword\nand cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,\u201d added the young man\nwith a melancholy smile, \u201cto make war against the English for ten\nyears, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy"
