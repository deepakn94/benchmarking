And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\npeculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from\nall quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\ndoubts.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\nwhistled.\n\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of\nthe window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\nand fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there\nis nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\n\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\nauthoritative tap.\n\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\n\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\nof obstinacy.\n\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\nmarked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\nhave I the honour to address?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\nalone.\u201d\n\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\nmy chair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before this\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\n\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he,\n\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\nEuropean history.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor. \u201cThe august\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\nnot exactly my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\nkings of Bohemia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\n\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI\nshould be better able to advise you.\u201d\n\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d\nhe cried; \u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\nBohemia.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n\n\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\nIrene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\nContralto\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes!\nRetired from operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in London\u2014quite so! Your\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\nthose letters back.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely so. But how\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\nprove their authenticity?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cImitated.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cBought.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\nindiscretion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d"
