Marseilles\u2014The Arrival\n\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\nsignalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and\nNaples.\n\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If,\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\n\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_,\nhas been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs\nto an owner of the city.\n\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\nPom\u00e8gue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker,\nbut so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is\nthe forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,\nfor she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the\nnarrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity\nand vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\ndirection of the pilot.\n\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\nalongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La\nR\u00e9serve basin.\n\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship\u2019s\nbulwarks.\n\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with\nblack eyes, and hair as dark as a raven\u2019s wing; and his whole\nappearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men\naccustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n\n\u201cAh, is it you, Dant\u00e8s?\u201d cried the man in the skiff. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nmatter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?\u201d\n\n\u201cA great misfortune, M. Morrel,\u201d replied the young man, \u201ca great\nmisfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave\nCaptain Leclere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the cargo?\u201d inquired the owner, eagerly.\n\n\u201cIs all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that\nhead. But poor Captain Leclere\u2014\u2014\ufffd"
