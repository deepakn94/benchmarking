input: " you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked,\n\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\ndown into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\nupon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\n\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it\nsaid, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\nwear a mask.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine that it\nmeans?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\nit?\u201d\n\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\nwritten.\n\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked,\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could not\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\nstiff.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is not an English\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\n\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d\nwith a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\n\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\n\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019\nwhich is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like\nour \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume\nfrom his shelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a\nGerman-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\nthat?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\nfrom his cigarette.\n\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\npeculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from\nall quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\ndoubts.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\nwhistled.\n\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of\nthe window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\nand fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there\nis nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes"
