A single man of large fortune;\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow so? how can it affect them?\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\n      them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d\n\n      \u201cDesign! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\n      the best of the party.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\n      thinking of her own beauty.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\n      comes into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\n      little Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\n      giving _her_ the preference.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he;\n      \u201cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\n      nerves.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\n      consideration these twenty years at least.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\n      will not visit them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\n      visit them all.\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\n      solace was visiting and news.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\n      with,\n\n      \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe are not in a way to"
