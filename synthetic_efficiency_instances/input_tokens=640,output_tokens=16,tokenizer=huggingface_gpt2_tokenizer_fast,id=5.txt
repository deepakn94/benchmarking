How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all\nthe right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you\u2019re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what\nan ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201d\n(Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and\nsometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer\neither question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but"
