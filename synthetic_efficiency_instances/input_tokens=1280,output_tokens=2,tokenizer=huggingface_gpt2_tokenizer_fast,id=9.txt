input: ", however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\naware of his fears.\n\n\u201cI want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\ntrifles,\u201d he thought, with an odd smile. \u201cHm... yes, all is in a man\u2019s\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that\u2019s an axiom. It would\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\ntoo much. It\u2019s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I\u2019ve learned to chatter this\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It\u2019s simply a fantasy to amuse\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.\u201d\n\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man\u2019s already\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man\u2019s refined face. He was,\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\nfood.\n\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\nthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\nsuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man\u2019s heart, that,\nin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\nof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\nacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\nmeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\nreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\ndray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: \u201cHey there, German\nhatter\u201d bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\nman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\nround hat from Zimmerman\u2019s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\ntorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\nfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\nhad overtaken him.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he muttered in confusion, \u201cI thought so! That\u2019s the worst\nof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\nspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\nand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\nsort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\na hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\nmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\na clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it\u2019s just such\ntrifles that always ruin everything....\u201d\n\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\nof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\nthis \u201chideous\u201d dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\n\u201crehearsal\u201d of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\nand more violent.\n\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was"
