When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\n      solace was visiting and news.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\n      with,\n\n      \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her\n      mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him\n      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\n      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\n      have no opinion of her.\u201d\n\n      \u201cNo more have I,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; \u201cand I am glad to find that\n      you do not depend on her serving you.\u201d\n\n      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\n      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n      \u201cDon\u2019t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven\u2019s sake! Have a little\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\u201d\n\n      \u201cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\u201d said her father; \u201cshe\n      times them ill.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI do not cough for my own amusement,\u201d replied Kitty fretfully.\n      \u201cWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\u201d\n\n      \u201cTo-morrow fortnight.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAye, so it is,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand Mrs. Long does not come\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\n      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.\u201d\n\n      \u201cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\n      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\u201d\n\n      \u201cI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\u2019s acquaintance is\n      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\n      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\n      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\n      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\n      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\u201d\n\n      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\n      \u201cNonsense, nonsense!\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\u201d cried he.\n      \u201cDo you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\n      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\n      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep\n      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.\u201d\n\n      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n\n      \u201cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\u201d he continued, \u201clet us return\n      to Mr. Bingley.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\u201d cried his wife.\n\n      \u201cI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so\n      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not\n      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\n      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\u201d\n\n      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\n      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first\n      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\n      had expected all the while.\n\n      \u201cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\n      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\n      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\n      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\n      never said a word about it till now.\u201d\n\n      \u201cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\u201d said Mr.\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\n      raptures of his wife.\n\n      \u201cWhat an excellent father you have, girls,\u201d said she, when the\n      door was shut. \u201cI do not know how you will ever make him amends\n      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.
