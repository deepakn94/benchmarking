input: "ghbourhood, this truth is so well\n      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is\n      considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their\n      daughters.\n\n      \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you\n      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\n      \u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and\n      she told me all about it.\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet made no answer.\n\n      \u201cDo not you want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife\n      impatiently.\n\n      \u201c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d\n\n      This was invitation enough.\n\n      \u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is\n      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;\n      that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the\n      place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.\n      Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before\n      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by\n      the end of next week.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\n\n      \u201cBingley.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIs he married or single?\u201d\n\n      \u201cOh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d\n\n      \u201cHow so? how can it affect them?\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\n      them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d\n\n      \u201cDesign! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\n      the best of the party.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\n      thinking of her own beauty.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\n      comes into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut consider your daughters.
