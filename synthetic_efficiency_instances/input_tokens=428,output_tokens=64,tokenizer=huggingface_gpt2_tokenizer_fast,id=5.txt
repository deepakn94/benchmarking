How brave they\u2019ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \u201cI wonder how\nmany miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all\nthe right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am,"
