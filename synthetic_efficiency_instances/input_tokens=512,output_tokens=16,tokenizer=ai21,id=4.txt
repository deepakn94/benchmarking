(that \u201cstern and just man,\u201d as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months\u2019 imprisonment\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: \u201cThey snapped\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\nus our lives.\u201d The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\n\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\nnever regained his sanity.\n\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\nDostoevsky\u2019s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\nhe began the \u201cDead House,\u201d and some years of service in a disciplinary\nbattalion.\n\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--\u201cVremya,\u201d which was\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother\u2019s debts. He started\nanother journal--\u201cThe Epoch,\u201d which within a few months was also\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother\u2019s family was\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\n\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\n\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\nvast multitude of mourners, who \u201cgave the hapless man the funeral of a\nking"
