input: " As I passed the well-remembered\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\nthat you intended to go into harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\nservant girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have\nbeen burned, had you lived"
