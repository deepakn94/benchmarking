It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\nthat you intended to go into harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\nservant girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\nhave changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\n\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\nprocess of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear"
