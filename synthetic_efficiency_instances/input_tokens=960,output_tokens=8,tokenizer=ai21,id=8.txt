Morrel,\u201d replied the young man, \u201ca great\nmisfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave\nCaptain Leclere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the cargo?\u201d inquired the owner, eagerly.\n\n\u201cIs all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that\nhead. But poor Captain Leclere\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d asked the owner, with an air of considerable\nresignation. \u201cWhat happened to the worthy captain?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died.\u201d\n\n\u201cFell into the sea?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.\u201d Then turning to\nthe crew, he said, \u201cBear a hand there, to take in sail!\u201d\n\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the\ncrew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and\nouthaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail\nclewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his\norders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to\nthe owner.\n\n\u201cAnd how did this misfortune occur?\u201d inquired the latter, resuming the\ninterrupted conversation.\n\n0023m\n\n\n\n\u201cAlas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the\nharbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.\nIn twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days\nafterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his\nrest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head\nand his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword\nand cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,\u201d added the young man\nwith a melancholy smile, \u201cto make war against the English for ten\nyears, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you see, Edmond,\u201d replied the owner, who appeared more comforted\nat every moment, \u201cwe are all mortal, and the old must make way for the\nyoung. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure\nme that the cargo\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise\nyou not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.\u201d\n\nThen, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:\n\u201cStand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!\u201d\n\nThe order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a\nman-of-war.\n\n\u201cLet go\u2014and clue up!\u201d At this last command all the sails were lowered,\nand the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.\n\n\u201cNow, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, observing the\nowner\u2019s impatience, \u201chere is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out\nof his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I\nmust look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.\u201d\n\nThe owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which\nDant\u00e8s flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit\nto a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man,\ngoing to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came\ntowards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of\nage, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors,\ninsolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as\nresponsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors,\nmade him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dant\u00e8s was beloved by\nthem.\n\n\u201cWell, M. Morrel,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cyou have heard of the misfortune\nthat has befallen us?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a first-rate seaman, one who had"
