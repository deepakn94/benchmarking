Well, how pleased I am! and it is\n      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\n      never said a word about it till now.\u201d\n\n      \u201cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\u201d said Mr.\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\n      raptures of his wife.\n\n      \u201cWhat an excellent father you have, girls,\u201d said she, when the\n      door was shut. \u201cI do not know how you will ever make him amends\n      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of\n      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\n      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do\n      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\n      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\u201d\n\n      \u201cOh!\u201d said Lydia stoutly, \u201cI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\n      youngest, I\u2019m the tallest.\u201d\n\n      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\n      would return Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and determining when they should\n      ask him to dinner.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\n      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\n      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\n      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,\n      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\n      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the\n      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\n      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\n      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\n      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\n      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\n      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\u2019s heart were entertained.\n\n      \u201cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\n      Netherfield,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \u201cand all the\n      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\u201d\n\n      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and sat\n      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\n      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\n      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\n      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\n      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and\n      rode a black horse.\n\n      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\n      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\n      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\n      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\n      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their\n      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\n      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\n      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\n      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\n      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\n      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\n      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\n      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\n      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\n      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\n      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from\n      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\n      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.\n      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\n      young man.\n\n      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\n      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\n      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\n      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\n      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\n      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\n      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\n      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\n      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\n      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\n      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\n      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to\n      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\n      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\n      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\n      compared with his friend.\n\n      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\n      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\n      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\n      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\n      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\n      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\n      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\n      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\n      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\n      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\n      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\n      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\n      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\n      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\n      daughters.\n\n      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\n      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\n      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a\n      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\n      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\n\n      \u201cCome, Darcy,\u201d said he, \u201cI must have you dance. I hate to see you\n      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\n      better dance.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\n      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\n      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\n      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\n      punishment to me to stand up with.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI would not be so fastidious as you are,\u201d cried Bingley,\n      \u201cfor a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\n      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\n      them you see uncommonly pretty.\u201d\n\n      \u201c_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\u201d said\n      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\n      \u201cOh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\n      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\n      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\n      to introduce you.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWhich do you mean?\u201d and turning round, he looked for a moment at\n      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\n      said, \u201cShe is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I\n      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\n      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\n      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\n      me.\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\n      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She\n      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\n      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\n      anything ridiculous.\n\n      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\n      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\n      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\n      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\n      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\n      Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\n      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\n      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\n      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet\n      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\n      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\n      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\n      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\n      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\n      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\n"
