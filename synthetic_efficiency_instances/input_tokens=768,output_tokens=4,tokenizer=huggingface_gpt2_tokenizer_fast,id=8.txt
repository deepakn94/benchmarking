However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,\nfor she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the\nnarrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity\nand vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\ndirection of the pilot.\n\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\nalongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La\nR\u00e9serve basin.\n\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship\u2019s\nbulwarks.\n\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with\nblack eyes, and hair as dark as a raven\u2019s wing; and his whole\nappearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men\naccustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n\n\u201cAh, is it you, Dant\u00e8s?\u201d cried the man in the skiff. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nmatter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?\u201d\n\n\u201cA great misfortune, M.
