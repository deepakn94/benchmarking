Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!\u201d\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n\u201cEAT ME\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said\nAlice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll\nget into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which\nway?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n\n\n\u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow I\u2019m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u201d\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m\nsure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be\nkind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.\u201d\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must\ngo by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending\npresents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n     _Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice\u2019s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like\nyou,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please,\nsir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that\u2019s_ the great puzzle!\u201d And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she\u2019s_ she, and _I\u2019m_ I, and\u2014oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome\u2014no, _that\u2019s_ all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018_How doth the little_\u2014\u2019\u201d and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:\u2014\n\n\u201cHow doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale!\n\n\u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019\nI shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down\nhere till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, \u201cI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!\u201d\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. \u201cHow _can_ I have done that?\u201d she thought. \u201cI must be\ngrowing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n\u201cThat _was_ a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand\nnow for the garden!\u201d and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than\never,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by\nrailway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.\u201d\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool"
