      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends
      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of
      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new
      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do

      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”

      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
      youngest, I’m the tallest.”

      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should
      ask him to dinner.
