I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\n      little Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\n      giving _her_ the preference.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he;\n      \u201cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.\u201d\n\n      \u201cMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\n      nerves.\u201d\n\n      \u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\n      consideration these twenty years at least.\u201d\n\n      \u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n      \u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\n      will not visit them.\u201d\n\n      \u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\n      visit them all.\u201d\n\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\n      solace was visiting and news.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\n      with,\n\n      \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\n\n      \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her\n      mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d\n\n      \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth,"
